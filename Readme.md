Curbside Pickup Application



Project Description

The Curbside Pickup Application is a React-based web application designed to facilitate curbside pickups for retail stores. It enables customers to place orders online and select a preferred pickup time. The application also provides store staff with the ability to manage and update order statuses in real-time.
